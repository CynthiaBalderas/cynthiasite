      <h2>Gameplay</h2>
      <p>
        Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a life-simulation game where you, the player, move to a deserted island and help build a new community from scratch. There are no time limits, combat, or traditional "stakes"—instead, the game invites you to fish, catch bugs, collect resources, decorate your home and island, and build relationships with your animal neighbors.

The real "stakes" in the game are emotional and creative. You make choices that shape your island's look and feel, and your relationships with the other characters. Progress is tied to your imagination, time investment, and attention to detail. It's a relaxing escape where you’re rewarded for slowing down and being present.

      <h2>Narrative Arc</h2>
      <p>
        While New Horizons doesn't follow a traditional story with rising action and a climax, it does have a loose arc of progression. You begin on a completely undeveloped island with just a tent. Gradually, through collecting resources, completing tasks, and earning in-game currency (bells and Nook Miles), you help upgrade the island’s infrastructure.

Key events include building new houses for residents, constructing bridges and inclines, and eventually unlocking the ability to terraform the island itself. The “plot” emerges from your evolving environment and your growing relationships with villagers—each with their own quirks, styles, and backstories.

      <h2>How The Game Ends</h2>
      <p>
        Technically, Animal Crossing: New Horizons doesn’t end. However, a major milestone is reached when you achieve a 3-star island rating, which prompts a concert from in-game musician K.K. Slider. This moment is often considered the game’s soft ending or climax.

After that, the game enters an open-ended phase where you can continue customizing your island, collecting seasonal items, inviting new villagers, or just vibing with your favorite characters. The end is really whatever you decide it to be.

      <h2>Why This Game Matters To Me</h2>
      <p>
        To me, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is more than just a cute, chill game—it is a meaningful space for creativity, reflection, and emotional connection. During the pandemic, it became a virtual safe haven for many people, myself included. It allowed us to “go outside,” connect with others, and find a sense of calm when the real world felt uncertain.

I find it compelling because it values the small, often overlooked parts of life—routine, ritual, friendship, and beauty in details. In a world that moves too fast, New Horizons teaches patience, kindness, and the joy of building something slowly over time.

     <h2>The "Reality Effect" in Animal Crossing</h2>
     <p>
       In Roland Barthes’ essay The Reality Effect, he talks about how random, unnecessary details in literature make a world feel real—not because they’re important, but precisely because they’re not. Animal Crossing is full of these details: the sound of rain on your roof, the way leaves rustle, or how villagers talk about things that have no gameplay impact at all. These moments are what make the world feel alive, not just functional. They're not necessary to "win"—but they’re what make it all matter.
